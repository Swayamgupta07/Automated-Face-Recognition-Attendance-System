# Automated Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is an **Automated Face Recognition Attendance System** that detects and recognizes faces from images to mark attendance. It leverages **OpenCV** and **face-recognition** libraries to identify individuals and log attendance in a CSV file.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition using **OpenCV** and **dlib**.
- Attendance tracking with automatic CSV updates.
- Supports multiple users by adding images to the `Images_Attendance` folder.
- Identifies known and unknown faces.
- Generates separate logs for **late** and **absent** users.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas face-recognition
```

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swayamgupta07/Automated-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
cd Automated-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
```

### 2. Create a Folder for Storing Images

Manually create a folder named **`Images_Attendance`** in the project directory.

- Add images of individuals who need to be recognized.
- Each image should be named as the person's **full name** (e.g., `John_Doe.jpg`).

### 3. Run the Project

```bash
python AttendanceProject.py
```

---

## Marking Attendance

- The program will **scan faces** and update the `Attendance.csv` file with the person's **name and timestamp**.
- If a person is **late**, their details are logged in `Late_Absent.csv`.

---

## Adding More Users

- To add more individuals, place their images inside the **`Images_Attendance`** folder.
- Make sure to **append their names** correctly in the CSV file if needed.
- Run the script again to include them in the recognition system.

## Notes

- Ensure **good lighting** and **clear images** for better recognition.
- Images should have **faces clearly visible** and not obstructed.
- The system may require **retraining** if new users are frequently added.
